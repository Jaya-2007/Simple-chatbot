##  Project Description

This project is a console-based Java ChatBot that interacts politely with users and can also perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The chatbot responds to greetings and general questions and switches to calculator mode when the user types operation keywords like `add`, `sub`, `mul`, or `div`.

##  Features

* Friendly conversational responses
* Performs basic math operations
* Handles division by zero
* Simple and beginner-friendly
## Technologies Used

* Java
* Scanner class
* Conditional statements
* Methods
## How to Run

1. Save the file as:
   ChatBot.java
2. Compile the program:
     bash
   javac ChatBot.java
3. Run the program:
   bash
   java ChatBot
  

##  How to Use

Type commands such as:

* `hi`, `hello`
* `how are you`
* `add`
* `sub`
* `mul`
* `div`
* `exit` (to stop the chatbot)

For arithmetic operations, the chatbot will ask for two numbers and display the result.
##  Sample Output

ChatBot: Hello! I am here to help you 
You: add
ChatBot: Enter first number: 3
ChatBot: Enter second number: 5
ChatBot: Result = 8
You: hi
ChatBot: Hello! Hope you are doing well 
You: exit
ChatBot: Thank you for chatting. Have a nice day

##  Concepts Covered

* Java Classes & Methods
* Scanner Input Handling
* if-else Decision Making
* Looping
* Basic Arithmetic Logic
##  Limitations

* Works only in console
* Does not store conversation history
* Uses keyword-based input
##  Future Enhancements

* Accept expressions like `add 10 20`
* GUI version using Swing or JavaFX
* File-based data storage
* Advanced NLP responses
